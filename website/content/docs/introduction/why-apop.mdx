# Why APoP?

## The Problem

AI agents are browsing, summarizing, and transacting on the web at an unprecedented scale. But without a shared standard, both websites and agents face **legal uncertainty and fragmentation** — slowing innovation on both sides.

### The Scale of the Problem

- **98% of websites have no machine-readable AI governance policy** — no way to tell agents what's allowed.
- High-profile disputes are already happening: Amazon accused Perplexity AI of scraping product data and ignoring `robots.txt` directives, highlighting the need for enforceable, granular AI authorization beyond legacy crawl directives.

### What's Broken Today

- **robots.txt is insufficient** — It was designed for search crawlers, not intelligent agents that summarize, extract data, submit forms, or make purchases.
- **No standard for intent declaration** — Agents don't tell websites what they intend to do.
- **No identity verification** — Websites can't verify that an agent is who it claims to be.
- **No rate limiting standard** — Each website rolls its own rate limiting, with no interoperability.
- **No cross-protocol coordination** — MCP, A2A, WebMCP each solve different problems, but none address website-level authorization.

### The Gap in the Agentic Stack

| Protocol       | What It Does                      | What It Doesn't Do                              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **WebMCP**     | Browser-native tool contracts     | No consent management                           |
| **MCP**        | Server-side tool/data integration | No website-level policies                       |
| **A2A**        | Agent-to-agent communication      | No resource owner authorization                 |
| **robots.txt** | Basic crawl directives            | No action control, no identity, no verification |

APoP fills the **authorization gap** — the missing layer between "how agents communicate" and "what websites allow."

## The Solution

APoP provides a simple, JSON-based policy file that websites serve at a well-known location. Agents discover and respect these policies automatically.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allow": true,
    "actions": ["read", "index", "summarize"],
    "disallow": ["extract", "automated_purchase"],
    "rateLimit": { "requests": 100, "window": "hour" },
    "requireVerification": false
  }
}
```

This single file creates mutual clarity — website owners set transparent rules, while agents get a clear, machine-readable signal of what's allowed.
