# What is APoP?

**Agent Policy Protocol (APoP)** is an open standard that lets websites declare how AI agents can access and interact with their content — with JSON Schema, verified identity, rate limits, and cross-protocol interop.

## The Core Idea

`agent-policy.json` defines how AI agents are allowed to interact with your website — what they can access, what actions are permitted, how often, and whether they must verify identity.

Think of it as **robots.txt for the agentic web**, built under the Agent Policy Protocol (APoP) standard. Place it at:

```
https://example.com/.well-known/agent-policy.json
```

## What APoP Provides

- **Transparent access rules** — Define clear permissions by path, action, and agent identity
- **Agent identity & verification** — PKIX, DID, Verifiable Credentials, partner tokens
- **Rate limiting** — Per-agent, per-window request limits with standard HTTP headers
- **Cross-protocol interop** — Links to MCP, A2A, WebMCP, UCP, APAAI
- **4 discovery methods** — Well-known URI, HTTP header, HTML meta, DNS TXT
- **10 action types** — `read`, `index`, `extract`, `summarize`, `render`, `api_call`, `form_submit`, `automated_purchase`, `tool_invoke`, `all`
- **3 custom HTTP status codes** — `430 Agent Action Not Allowed`, `438 Agent Rate Limited`, `439 Agent Verification Required`

## Quick Summary

| Feature            | Details                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Discovery**      | 4 methods with defined priority |
| **Actions**        | 10 standard action types        |
| **Status Codes**   | 430, 438, 439                   |
| **Identity Tiers** | Anonymous, Identified, Verified |
| **Verification**   | PKIX, DID, VC, Partner Token    |
| **Interop**        | A2A, MCP, WebMCP, UCP, APAAI    |

## Minimal Example

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allow": true,
    "actions": ["read", "summarize"],
    "rateLimit": { "requests": 100, "window": "hour" }
  }
}
```

## Who Is APoP For?

- **Website owners** who want to set clear, transparent rules for AI agent interactions
- **AI agent developers** who want to build with confidence — knowing what's allowed
- **Platform teams** deploying middleware to enforce agent policies at scale
- **Standards bodies** looking for the authorization layer to complement MCP, A2A, and WebMCP
