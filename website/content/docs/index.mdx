# Agent Policy Protocol Documentation

Welcome to the APoP documentation. Get started quickly or dive deep into the specification.

- **[Examples](/docs/examples/news-publisher)** — Real-world policy examples

## Why APoP?

AI agents are browsing, summarizing, and transacting on the web — but websites have no standardized way to express consent or control. APoP is the open standard that fills this gap.

With a single `agent-policy.json` file, you can:

- **Control access** — Allow or deny AI agents per path, action, and identity
- **Set rate limits** — Define request quotas per agent with standard HTTP headers
- **Verify identity** — Require cryptographic proof of agent identity (PKIX, DID, VC)
- **Interoperate** — Link to MCP, A2A, WebMCP, and other agentic protocols

## Get Started

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allow": true,
    "actions": ["read", "summarize"],
    "rateLimit": { "requests": 100, "window": "hour" }
  }
}
```

Place this at `/.well-known/agent-policy.json` on your website. That's it!
