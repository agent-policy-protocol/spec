# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about the Agent Policy Protocol and how to use it effectively.

## General Questions

### What is APoP?

Agent Policy Protocol (APoP) is an open standard that enables websites to declare how AI agents can access and interact with their content. It provides a standardized way to specify permissions, rate limits, verification requirements, and interoperability with other protocols.

### How is APoP different from robots.txt?

While robots.txt provides simple crawl directives for search engines, APoP offers:

- **Rich action vocabulary** — Beyond just "allow" and "disallow", APoP supports actions like read, summarize, extract, train, execute, and more
- **Agent verification** — Support for cryptographic identity verification through PKIX, DID, and Verifiable Credentials
- **Rate limiting** — Built-in request quotas with standard HTTP headers
- **Protocol interoperability** — Links to MCP, A2A, WebMCP, and other agentic protocols
- **Path-specific policies** — Different rules for different parts of your site
- **JSON Schema validation** — Structured, machine-readable policies

### Is APoP a replacement for robots.txt?

No, APoP complements robots.txt. Robots.txt remains the standard for traditional web crawlers. APoP adds agent-specific authorization for the new generation of AI-powered interactions.

### Who should implement APoP?

APoP is valuable for:

- **Content publishers** wanting to control how AI agents use their content
- **SaaS platforms** offering agent-accessible APIs
- **E-commerce sites** enabling AI-powered shopping assistants
- **Healthcare and financial services** requiring verified agent identities
- **Open data portals** encouraging agent access with clear terms

## Implementation Questions

### Where do I place my agent-policy.json file?

The recommended location is:

```
https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/agent-policy.json
```

This follows the RFC 8615 well-known URI standard.

### What's the minimum policy I need?

A minimal policy only needs the version field:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allow": true
  }
}
```

However, we recommend also specifying allowed actions and rate limits.

### How do I test my policy?

Use the [APoP Playground](/playground) to:

1. Build your policy with real-time validation
2. Test against the JSON Schema
3. Preview how agents will interpret it
4. Export the validated policy

You can also validate programmatically using our SDKs or the JSON Schema directly.

### Do I need to implement all four discovery methods?

No. The well-known URI is sufficient for most cases:

```
GET /.well-known/agent-policy.json
```

Additional discovery methods (HTTP header, HTML meta, DNS TXT) provide redundancy and flexibility for different deployment scenarios.

## Policy Configuration Questions

### How do I allow reading but prevent training?

Use the action-based policy:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allow": true,
    "actions": ["read", "summarize", "index"],
    "disallowedActions": ["train", "extract"]
  }
}
```

### Can I have different policies for different paths?

Yes, use `pathPolicies`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "defaultPolicy": { "allow": false },
  "pathPolicies": [
    {
      "path": "/blog/*",
      "allow": true,
      "actions": ["read", "summarize"]
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/*",
      "allow": true,
      "actions": ["api_call"],
      "rateLimit": { "requests": 100, "window": "hour" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### How do I require agent verification?

Enable verification in your policy:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "verification": {
    "required": true,
    "methods": ["pkix", "did"],
    "trustedIssuers": ["https://agents.example.com/registry"]
  },
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allow": true
  }
}
```

Agents must then provide cryptographic proof of identity via the `Agent-Verification` header.

### What are good rate limit values?

It depends on your use case:

- **Public blogs**: 30-100 requests/hour
- **Documentation sites**: 100-500 requests/hour
- **APIs**: 1000-10000 requests/day (with tiered limits)
- **High-security sites**: 10-50 requests/hour with verification

Start conservative and adjust based on your server capacity and agent behavior.

## Agent Questions

### How do agents discover my policy?

Agents use a four-method waterfall:

1. **Well-known URI** — GET `/.well-known/agent-policy.json`
2. **HTTP Header** — Check `Agent-Policy` header in responses
3. **HTML Meta** — Parse `<meta name="agent-policy">` tags
4. **DNS TXT** — Query `_agentpolicy.yourdomain.com`

The first method that succeeds is used.

### What if an agent ignores my policy?

APoP is designed as a consent and clarity mechanism, not enforcement. However:

- Legitimate agents respect policies to maintain ecosystem trust
- You can use standard web protections (firewalls, rate limiting, IP blocks)
- Custom HTTP status codes (430, 438, 439) help agents understand violations
- Verified agent identity enables accountability

### Can I allowlist specific agents?

Yes, use the `agentPolicies` field:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "agentPolicies": [
    {
      "userAgent": "MyTrustedAgent/1.0",
      "allow": true,
      "actions": ["all"],
      "rateLimit": { "requests": 1000, "window": "hour" }
    }
  ],
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allow": false
  }
}
```

## Integration Questions

### Does APoP work with MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

Yes! APoP includes `protocolLinks` for interoperability:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "protocolLinks": {
    "mcp": "https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/mcp.json"
  }
}
```

This links to your MCP endpoint, enabling agents to discover both authorization policies and available tools.

### How do I integrate APoP with my Next.js app?

Use the official Node.js SDK:

```bash
npm install @apop/sdk
```

Then add middleware:

```typescript
import { apopMiddleware } from "@apop/sdk/middleware";

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/api/:path*"],
};

export default apopMiddleware({
  policyPath: "./.well-known/agent-policy.json",
});
```

See the [Next.js integration guide](/docs/guides/nextjs) for details.

### Is there a WordPress plugin?

Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. In the meantime, you can manually place your `agent-policy.json` file in the WordPress site root or use the [WordPress integration guide](/docs/guides/wordpress).

## Schema and Specification Questions

### Where can I find the JSON Schema?

The schema is available at:

- **URL**: https://agentpolicy.org/schema/agent-policy.schema.json
- **Within policy**: Use `"$schema"` field for IDE autocompletion

### Is APoP versioned?

Yes. The current version is **1.0**. All policies must include:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

Future versions will be backward compatible when possible, with clear migration guides.
