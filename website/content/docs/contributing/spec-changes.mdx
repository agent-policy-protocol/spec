# Proposing Spec Changes

The APoP specification is a living document. We welcome proposals to improve it.

## Process

### 1. Open a Discussion First

Before writing code, start a **GitHub Discussion** in the [spec repository](https://github.com/agent-policy-protocol/spec/discussions):

- Describe the problem or gap
- Explain your proposed solution
- Provide examples showing before/after
- Tag it with the `spec` label

### 2. Get Community Feedback

Allow at least 7 days for community feedback. Key questions to address:

- Does this break backward compatibility?
- How does it affect existing implementations?
- Is there a simpler way to achieve the same goal?
- Does it overlap with other fields in the spec?

### 3. Write the RFC

If the community supports the idea, write a formal proposal:

```markdown
# RFC: [Title]

## Summary

One-paragraph summary of the change.

## Motivation

Why this change is needed.

## Specification

Exact changes to the spec documents, schema, and types.

## Examples

Before/after JSON examples.

## Backward Compatibility

Impact on existing policies and SDKs.

## Alternatives Considered

Other approaches that were evaluated.
```

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

- Fork the spec repository
- Create a branch: `rfc/your-feature-name`
- Update the relevant spec documents in `spec/`
- Update `spec/schema/agent-policy.schema.json` if the change affects the schema
- Update TypeScript types in `sdk/node/src/types.ts`
- Update Python types in `sdk/python/src/apop/types.py`
- Add conformance tests in `tests/conformance/`
- Open a PR with the RFC in the description

### 5. Review and Merge

The maintainers will review the PR. Spec changes require:

- At least 2 maintainer approvals
- All conformance tests passing
- Updated documentation
- Updated example policies (if applicable)

## Types of Spec Changes

### Minor (patch versions)

- Clarifications to existing text
- Additional examples
- Fixing typos or formatting

### Moderate (minor versions)

- New optional fields
- New action types
- New verification methods
- New discovery methods

### Breaking (major versions)

- Removing or renaming existing fields
- Changing field types
- Removing action types
- Changing status codes

## Schema Change Guidelines

When modifying `agent-policy.schema.json`:

1. Use JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 syntax
2. Add `description` to every new field
3. Add `default` values where sensible
4. Add `examples` where helpful
5. Run schema validation against all examples: `cd tests/conformance && npm test`

## Notes

- All spec changes must be backward-compatible unless a new major version is released.
- The `version` field in the spec uses semantic versioning.
- The spec is licensed under Apache 2.0.
