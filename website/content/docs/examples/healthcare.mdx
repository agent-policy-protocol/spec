# Healthcare (HIPAA)

A policy template for healthcare organizations that need HIPAA-compliant agent policies with deny-by-default access and strict verification requirements.

## Use Case

- Deny all agent access by default for maximum security
- Block all access to patient records and personal data
- Allow only verified, allowlisted agents to book appointments
- Provide public information (hours, locations, services) without verification
- Require Verifiable Credentials from HIPAA-compliant issuers

## Full Policy

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agentpolicy.org/schema/v1/agent-policy.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0",
  "policyUrl": "https://hospital.example.com/.well-known/agent-policy.json",

      "allow": false,
      "disallow": ["all"]
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/v1/appointments/*",
      "allow": true,
      "actions": ["api_call"],
      "requireVerification": true,

```

## How It Works

### Deny-by-Default

The `defaultPolicy` uses `allow: false` with `disallow: ["all"]` — blocking every agent action unless explicitly permitted. This is the most secure starting point for sensitive environments.

### Patient Data Protection

Both `/patient/**` and `/records/**` paths are explicitly blocked with `disallow: ["all"]`, ensuring no agent can access protected health information (PHI).

### Allowlisted Appointments

Only verified agents from trusted healthcare platforms (Epic, Google Health) can access the appointment booking API, with strict rate limits of 20 requests/hour.

### Public Information

The `/public/**` path allows reading and indexing of non-sensitive content like office hours, locations, and general health information — no verification required.

### HIPAA Compliance

The policy requires Verifiable Credentials from `did:web:hipaa-compliance.hhs.gov`, ensuring that only agents with provable HIPAA compliance credentials can access sensitive functionality.
