# Personal Blog

A simple, lightweight policy for personal blogs that want to allow AI agents to read and summarize content.

## Use Case

- Allow reading, indexing, and summarizing of all blog posts
- Block data extraction and sensitive actions
- No verification required — keep it simple
- Block admin paths

## Full Policy

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agentpolicy.org/schema/v1/agent-policy.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0",
  "policyUrl": "https://myblog.example.com/.well-known/agent-policy.json",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allow": true,
    "actions": ["read", "index", "summarize"],
    "disallow": [
      "extract",
      "api_call",
      "form_submit",
      "automated_purchase",
      "tool_invoke"
    ],
    "rateLimit": {
      "requests": 100,
      "window": "hour"
    },
    "requireVerification": false
  },
  "pathPolicies": [
    {
      "path": "/posts/**",
      "allow": true,
      "actions": ["read", "index", "summarize"],
      "requireVerification": false
    },
    {
      "path": "/feed/*",
      "allow": true,
      "actions": ["read", "index"],
      "requireVerification": false
    },
    {
      "path": "/admin/**",
      "allow": false
    },
    {
      "path": "/wp-admin/**",
      "allow": false
    }
  ],
  "contact": {
    "email": "hello@myblog.example.com"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Simple personal blog: allow reading, indexing, and summarizing all posts. No verification needed. Block extraction and admin paths.",
    "owner": "Jane Doe",
    "lastModified": "2026-02-14T00:00:00Z",
    "license": "CC-BY-4.0"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Simple and Permissive

The default policy allows the three most common agent actions — read, index, and summarize. This lets AI assistants cite your blog posts when users ask questions.

### Extraction Block

The `disallow` list blocks extraction, API calls, form submission, automated purchases, and tool invocations. This prevents scraping while allowing fair use.

### No Verification

Personal blogs rarely need agent verification. Keeping `requireVerification: false` means all well-behaved agents can interact immediately.

### CC-BY License

The `CC-BY-4.0` license in metadata signals that content can be freely used with attribution — a common choice for personal blogs.

### When to Use This Template

Ideal for personal blogs, hobby sites, portfolios, and any small site where you want AI agents to discover and share your content while preventing abusive scraping.
