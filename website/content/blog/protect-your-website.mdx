AI agents are already visiting your website. They're reading content, summarizing articles, and interacting on behalf of users. The good news: you can define clear, transparent rules for how they engage — in under 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Create Your Policy

Create a file called `agent-policy.json`:

```json
{
  "apopVersion": "1.0",
  "policyVersion": "1.0.0",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allowedActions": ["read", "navigate", "summarize"],
    "disallowedActions": ["train", "execute"],
    "rateLimit": {
      "maxRequests": 100,
      "windowSeconds": 60
    }
  },
  "contact": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

This policy says: agents can read your pages, follow links, and summarize content. They're limited to 100 requests per minute. Training and executing actions require separate permission.

Don't want to write JSON by hand? **[Use the playground →](/playground)** to build your policy visually with [9 pre-built templates](/docs/examples/news-publisher). You can also review the [full policy specification](/docs/specification/overview) to understand all available options.

## Step 2: Deploy It

You have three options for serving your policy file.

### Option A: Static File (simplest)

Place the file at `/.well-known/agent-policy.json` on your web server:

```bash
# Nginx / Apache — just copy the file
mkdir -p .well-known
cp agent-policy.json .well-known/agent-policy.json
```

### Option B: Express Middleware (Node.js)

```bash
npm install @anthropic/agentpolicy
```

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { createMiddleware } from "@anthropic/agentpolicy/express";

const app = express();

app.use(
  createMiddleware({
    policyPath: "./agent-policy.json",
  }),
);

app.listen(3000);
```

The middleware automatically:

- Serves the policy at `/.well-known/agent-policy.json`
- Validates agent requests against your policy
- Returns `430 Agent Action Not Allowed` for violations
- Adds APoP headers to every response

### Option C: Vercel (zero-config)

Just put the file in your `public` directory:

```plaintext
public/
  .well-known/
    agent-policy.json
```

Deploy to Vercel and it's live. That's it.

## Step 3: Test It

Verify your policy is accessible:

```bash
curl -s https://yoursite.com/.well-known/agent-policy.json | head -20
```

Now simulate an agent trying to do something disallowed:

```bash
curl -i \
  -H "Agent-Name: TestBot/1.0" \
  -H "Agent-Intent: extract" \
  https://yoursite.com/api/data
```

If you're using the middleware, you'll see:

```http
HTTP/1.1 430 Agent Action Not Allowed
Agent-Policy: /.well-known/agent-policy.json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "agent_action_not_allowed",
  "message": "Action 'extract' is not permitted by the site's agent policy",
  "policyUrl": "/.well-known/agent-policy.json"
}
```

**Status 430** is APoP's custom HTTP status code — it tells the agent exactly why access was denied and where to find the policy.

## What About Agents That Don't Check the Policy?

This is a fair question. APoP works on two levels:

1. **Cooperative agents** (most commercial AI agents) — they discover and respect policies because clear rules let them build better products with legal confidence. Violating policies risks losing access entirely.

2. **Middleware enforcement** — the APoP middleware actively enforces policies by inspecting headers and returning 430 responses. Combined with rate limiting, this ensures consistent enforcement.

As APoP adoption grows, major AI providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI) will have market incentive to respect these policies — just as they currently respect `robots.txt`.

## Next Steps

You've set clear rules for your site. Here's what to explore next:

- **[Path-specific policies](/docs/specification/schema-reference)** — different rules for different sections
- **[Agent verification](/docs/specification/agent-identification)** — verified agent identity builds trust
- **[9 policy templates](/docs/examples/news-publisher)** — pre-built policies for common use cases (news, e-commerce, healthcare, SaaS, and more)
- **[Integration guides](/docs/guides/nextjs)** — Next.js, FastAPI, WordPress, and Docker
- **[Join the community](/community)** — help shape the standard

The agentic web is here. Clear rules make it work for everyone.
