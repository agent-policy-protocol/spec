AI agents are already visiting your website. They're summarizing your content, extracting your data, and in some cases, taking actions you never authorized. The good news: you can take control in under 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Create Your Policy

Create a file called `agent-policy.json`:

```json
{
  "apopVersion": "1.0",
  "policyVersion": "1.0.0",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allowedActions": ["read", "navigate"],
    "disallowedActions": ["summarize", "extract", "train", "execute"],
    "rateLimit": {
      "maxRequests": 60,
      "windowSeconds": 60
    }
  },
  "contact": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

This policy says: agents can read your pages and follow links, but they **cannot** summarize your content, extract data, use it for training, or execute actions. They're limited to 60 requests per minute.

Don't want to write JSON by hand? **[Use the playground →](/playground)** to build your policy visually.

## Step 2: Deploy It

You have three options for serving your policy file.

### Option A: Static File (simplest)

Place the file at `/.well-known/agent-policy.json` on your web server:

```bash
# Nginx / Apache — just copy the file
mkdir -p .well-known
cp agent-policy.json .well-known/agent-policy.json
```

### Option B: Express Middleware (Node.js)

```bash
npm install @anthropic/agentpolicy
```

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { createMiddleware } from "@anthropic/agentpolicy/express";

const app = express();

app.use(
  createMiddleware({
    policyPath: "./agent-policy.json",
  }),
);

app.listen(3000);
```

The middleware automatically:

- Serves the policy at `/.well-known/agent-policy.json`
- Validates agent requests against your policy
- Returns `430 Agent Action Not Allowed` for violations
- Adds APoP headers to every response

### Option C: Vercel (zero-config)

Just put the file in your `public` directory:

```
public/
  .well-known/
    agent-policy.json
```

Deploy to Vercel and it's live. That's it.

## Step 3: Test It

Verify your policy is accessible:

```bash
curl -s https://yoursite.com/.well-known/agent-policy.json | head -20
```

Now simulate an agent trying to do something disallowed:

```bash
curl -i \
  -H "Agent-Name: TestBot/1.0" \
  -H "Agent-Intent: extract" \
  https://yoursite.com/api/data
```

If you're using the middleware, you'll see:

```
HTTP/1.1 430 Agent Action Not Allowed
Agent-Policy: /.well-known/agent-policy.json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "agent_action_not_allowed",
  "message": "Action 'extract' is not permitted by the site's agent policy",
  "policyUrl": "/.well-known/agent-policy.json"
}
```

**Status 430** is APoP's custom HTTP status code — it tells the agent exactly why access was denied and where to find the policy.

## What About Agents That Don't Respect the Policy?

This is the right question. APoP works on two levels:

1. **Cooperative agents** (most commercial AI agents) — they discover and respect policies because it's in their interest. Violating policies risks being blocked entirely.

2. **Non-cooperative agents** — the middleware actively enforces policies by inspecting headers and returning 430 responses. Combined with rate limiting, this provides real protection.

As APoP adoption grows, major AI providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI) will have market pressure to respect these policies — just as they currently respect `robots.txt`.

## Next Steps

You've protected your site. Here's what to explore next:

- **[Path-specific policies](/docs/specification/overview)** — different rules for different sections
- **[Agent verification](/docs/specification/agent-identification)** — require cryptographic identity
- **[9 policy templates](/docs/examples/news-publisher)** — pre-built policies for common use cases
- **[Join the community](/community)** — help shape the standard

The agentic web is here. Make sure your website has a voice in how agents interact with it.
