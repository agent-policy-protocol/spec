Today we're open-sourcing the **Agent Policy Protocol (APoP)** — a new standard that enables AI agents and websites to work together with clear, transparent rules.

APoP is to AI agents what a passport system is to international travelers. Your website declares its permissions. Agents discover those permissions. And the ecosystem has a shared language for consent, identity, and collaboration.

## The Problem

The agentic web is exploding. AI agents powered by large language models are:

- Browsing websites on behalf of users
- Summarizing content for AI search engines
- Extracting data for model training
- Executing transactions autonomously
- Interacting through protocols like MCP, A2A, and WebMCP

But without clear rules, agents guess what’s allowed — leading to legal conflicts, blanket blocking, and slowed innovation. `robots.txt` can block crawlers, but it can't say "you may read my content but not use it for training" or "verify your identity before accessing my API."

## How APoP Works

APoP uses a JSON document — `agent-policy.json` — served at a well-known URL. Here's a minimal example:

```json
{
  "apopVersion": "1.0",
  "defaultPolicy": {
    "allowedActions": ["read", "navigate"],
    "disallowedActions": ["train", "extract"]
  }
}
```

This says: agents may read and navigate the site, but they may not use the content for training or extract structured data.

### Discovery

Agents discover your policy through four methods:

1. **Well-Known URI**: `GET /.well-known/agent-policy.json`
2. **HTTP Header**: `Agent-Policy: /.well-known/agent-policy.json`
3. **HTML Meta Tag**: `<meta name="agent-policy" content="...">`
4. **DNS TXT Record**: `_agentpolicy.example.com TXT "policy_url=..."`

### Agent Identity

APoP defines three identity tiers:

- **Self-declared**: Agent sends its name and version in HTTP headers
- **Verified**: Agent proves identity via PKIX certificates or DID
- **Trusted**: Agent is on an allowlist in your policy

```json
{
  "verification": {
    "required": true,
    "methods": ["pkix", "did"],
    "registryUrl": "https://agents.example.com/registry"
  }
}
```

### Action Vocabulary

APoP defines a rich set of actions that go beyond "allow" and "disallow":

| Action      | Description                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `read`      | View/read content                 |
| `summarize` | Create summaries of content       |
| `extract`   | Extract structured data           |
| `train`     | Use content for model training    |
| `navigate`  | Follow links, browse pages        |
| `execute`   | Execute transactions/actions      |
| `store`     | Cache or store content            |
| `modify`    | Create, update, or delete content |

### Path-Level Policies

Different parts of your site can have different rules:

```json
{
  "pathPolicies": [
    {
      "path": "/blog/*",
      "allowedActions": ["read", "summarize"],
      "rateLimit": { "maxRequests": 30, "windowSeconds": 60 }
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/*",
      "allowedActions": ["read", "execute"],
      "verification": { "required": true }
    },
    {
      "path": "/admin/*",
      "disallowedActions": ["*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rate Limiting

Built-in rate limiting per path, per agent:

```json
{
  "rateLimit": {
    "maxRequests": 100,
    "windowSeconds": 3600
  }
}
```

## Cross-Protocol Interoperability

The agentic web isn't one protocol — it's many. APoP is designed to complement, not compete with, existing standards:

| Protocol   | Purpose                      | APoP's Role                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **MCP**    | Tool/context for LLMs        | Authorize which MCP tools agents can use         |
| **A2A**    | Agent-to-agent communication | Set policies for inter-agent interactions        |
| **WebMCP** | Web discovery for MCP        | Provide authorization layer for WebMCP endpoints |
| **UCP**    | Universal context protocol   | Govern context sharing policies                  |

APoP fills the **authorization gap** — it's the layer that creates mutual clarity about who can do what, where, and how often.

## SDKs: Get Started in Minutes

### Node.js

```bash
npm install @anthropic/agentpolicy
```

```typescript
import { createMiddleware } from "@anthropic/agentpolicy/express";
import express from "express";

const app = express();
app.use(
  createMiddleware({
    policyPath: "./agent-policy.json",
  }),
);
```

### Python

```bash
pip install apop
```

```python
from apop.middleware.fastapi import AgentPolicyMiddleware
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(AgentPolicyMiddleware, policy_path="./agent-policy.json")
```

## What's Next

APoP v1.0 is available today as an open standard under the Apache 2.0 license. Here's how to get involved:

- **[Read the full specification →](/docs/specification/overview)**
- **[Try the playground →](/playground)** — build your policy in-browser
- **[Install the SDK →](/docs/sdks/overview)** — Node.js and Python
- **[Star us on GitHub →](https://github.com/agent-policy-protocol/spec)** — and contribute

The agentic web deserves an authorization layer. APoP is that layer. Like robots.txt enabled the search engine era, APoP enables the agentic era. Let's build it together.
